# Alien-Mouse-Avoider
The repository for a Mouse Avoider game that is themed after the movie Alien.

This was my first official game made in Python, as a school project in Professor David Johnson's COMP 1010 class at the University of Utah (who provided some of the starter code).

It's based off the movie Alien, and I changed the cursor to make it look like Ripley (although my art skills don't do her justice). There's a couple of different endings (which just equate to different text) depending on whether or not you save Jonesy in the second stage.

All the images were created by me, although none of it is all that impressive.
